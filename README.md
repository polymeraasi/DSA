This repository contains the two projects made on the course Data Structures and Algorithms. 
The first project creates a program where information about affiliations and their publications can be entered and retrieved. 
The publications can refer to each other, which links them together. 
The second project expanses the first by implementing a graph, which connects the affiliations based on shared publications. 

Please note that the projects were made with a given template. Thus, the only part I have modified in each of the .hh -files is the private interface.
